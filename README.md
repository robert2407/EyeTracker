## ✨ Features

- **Mode 1: Eye-Controlled Mouse**
  - Quick mini-calibration step.  
  - Control your mouse cursor through eye movement.  

- **Mode 2: Gaze Detection with KNN**
  - Uses a simple pretrained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.  
  - Detects where on the screen you are looking.  

- **Blink Counter**
  - Tracks the number of blinks in real-time.  

- **Fatigue Detection**
  - Monitors blink frequency and duration.  
  - Provides a simple indicator of potential eye strain or fatigue.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** for computer vision and face/eye detection.  
- **Mediapipe** for facial landmarks (depending on implementation).  
- **scikit-learn** for the pretrained KNN model.
